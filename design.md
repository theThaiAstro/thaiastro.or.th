## Colours

### Primary Colour

The primary colour is blue, specifically `#001980` which is the year the Thai Astronomical Society was established (1980).

For accessibility, `#001980` paired with white (`#ffffff`) is excellent at whopping 14.48:1

### Hover Behaviours

When the mouse is over an element that is clickable, the the colour (both background and text) should be darker by at least 200 points (e.g., `500` âž” `700`).

```html
<button class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">
    Click me
</button>
```
